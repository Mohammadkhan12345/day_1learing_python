Python Basic Programs

This repository contains several basic Python programs covering fundamental concepts such as input handling, mathematical operations, conditional statements, and variable swapping. These programs are useful for beginners learning Python.

Programs Included

1. Print "Hello World"

A simple program to print "Hello World" to the console.

2. Add Two Numbers

Accepts two numbers as input from the user.

Computes their sum and displays the result.

3. Find Square Root

Two methods to find the square root of a given number:

Using the math.sqrt() function.

Using the exponentiation operator **(0.5).

4. Calculate Area of a Rectangle

Takes length and breadth as input and calculates the area using the formula:

Area = Length × Breadth

5. Calculate Area of a Triangle

Accepts height and base as input.

Computes the area using the formula:

Area = 0.5 × Height × Base

6. Swap Two Variables

Two methods to swap the values of two variables:

Using a temporary variable.

Using tuple unpacking (x, y = y, x).

7. Kilometers to Miles Converter

Converts kilometers to miles using the formula:

Miles = Kilometers × 0.621371

8. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

Takes a number as input and determines whether it is:

Positive

Negative

Zero

9. Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Determines whether a given number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).

How to Run the Programs

Install Python (if not already installed) from python.org.

Save the script as basic_programs.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the script using:

python basic_programs.py

Follow the on-screen instructions for user inputs.

Requirements

Python 3.x

No additional libraries required (except for math in the square root program).
